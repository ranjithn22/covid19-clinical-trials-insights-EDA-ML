# 🩺 COVID-19 Clinical Trials Analysis – EDA, Machine Learning & Dashboard

This project provides a **complete end-to-end data analysis pipeline** of global COVID-19 clinical trials, combining **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Machine Learning**, **SQL queries**, and **interactive data visualization** with Tableau. It aims to deliver valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals to understand the trends, patterns, and progress of COVID-19 research worldwide.

---

## 📊 Overview

The data is sourced from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/), a global database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies.  
This project explores the data to uncover:

- Trial status distributions and phase progressions  
- Participant enrollment trends  
- Country-wise research activity  
- Timeline analysis of clinical trial initiation  
- Predictive modeling of trial statuses using machine learning  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform thorough **data cleaning** and **EDA** to understand the structure and insights of COVID-19 clinical trials.  
- Visualize **trial phases, enrollment, status, and geographic distribution**.  
- Analyze **trends over time** in global research activity.  
- Build a **Random Forest model** to predict the trial status.  
- Create a **Tableau dashboard** for easy visualization and storytelling.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Most clinical trials are in the **"Completed"** phase, reflecting successful research completion.  
- **United States, France, UK, Italy, and Spain** contributed the majority of trials globally.  
- Participant enrollment patterns vary significantly across different phases.  
- The timeline analysis shows a **spike in new trials** during major COVID-19 waves.  
- A **Random Forest classifier** achieved ~56% accuracy in predicting trial status.
